  title    = {A Meta-Heuristic for Example Invention},
  author   = {Jones, Raphael and Howard, Peter},
  pages    = {1-9},
  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of inventing examples to convey features of an abstract specification. We provide a straightforward meta-technique to develop examples by writing any old rubbish that fills up space but still reads like English. Experiments show that this approach fares better than ``lorum ipsum'' text in a variety of cases. Running time (including LaTeX mathematics) is $O(1)$.}

  title    = {Example Generalization via Skim Reading},
  author   = {K\"oller, Klaus and Frankel, David and Deutsch, Mark},
  pages    = {10-18},
  abstract = {We show how skim reading a small number of examples can give a good sense of a more abstract specification. This is a complementary paper to (Jones et al. 2013) which shares the same first author as this paper and so must be properly disambiguated.}

  author   = {Smythe, Byron and Gordon, Trent},
  pages    = {19-26},
  abstract = {We empirically verify that, for the purposes of conveying the details of an abstract BibTeX specification, three example suffice. The related problem of whether three examples are necessary is left as future work.}

  author   = {von Hamburg, Hans and van der Petersburg, Pieter and de Gier, Willhelm and Hirst, Jr, Peter},
  pages    = {27-41},
  abstract = {We demonstrate the ability of scripts to parse names containing prefixes such as 'van der' or 'von'. As a further extension, we consider suffices to names such as 'Jr' and 'III'.}
